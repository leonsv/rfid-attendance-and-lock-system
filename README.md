This project presents an innovative RFID Card Attendance System leveraging Arduino technology for efficient tracking and management.
By integrating RFID technology with Arduino, the system offers a secure and automated method for recording attendance.
Each student or participant is assigned a unique RFID card, which, when swiped, communicates with the Arduino module to register the attendance data.
The system aims to streamline traditional attendance processes, reduce manual efforts, and enhance overall accuracy. 
This project discusses the design, implementation, and evaluation of the RFID Card Attendance System, highlighting its potential in optimizing attendance management in various educational and organizational settings.
